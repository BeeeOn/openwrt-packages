OpenWrt Packages
================

This repository contains OpenWrt Makefiles for adaapp and some of the
libraries it depends on. This repository can be imported as a package
feed into the OpenWrt SDK via the feeds.conf file.

The packages were developed for use on Turris and Omnia routers but should
work other OpenWrt devices as well.
